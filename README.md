Command-Line Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
Implement the first version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game as a command-line
program:
• Each game has 20 rounds.
• Prompt the human player for each round’s choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
• The computer makes a random choice.
What can change in future versions of this program:
• How the opposing (i.e., human) player’s choices are obtained.
• How the computer makes its choices (it may not always be random)

Written report
In a short (2- or 3-page) report, describe:
• How you encapsulated code that will change.
• How you used the Law of Demeter.
• Your implementation of cohesive classes.
• Your implementation of loosely-coupled classes.
What to turn in
Make a zip file of all your C++ source files and your report. Submit it into Canvas:
Assignment #3. Command-Line Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
This is a team assignment. Each member of the team will receive the same score.

• As implemented by the program and described by the report: (25 pts each)
o How well code that will change is encapsulated.
o How well the program uses the Law of Demeter.
o How well the implemented classes are cohesive.
o How well the implemented classes are loosely coupled.
